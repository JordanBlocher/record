Install the following packages in Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 libasound2-dev

and run it:

./record.py

It produces a wav file in the tmp directory (it tells you which) and a set of
png images. It also suggests you exact commands how to create videos from it,
using either mencoder or ffmpeg2theora (it's up to you).

In my experience mencoder can't sync the sound and video correctly, while
ffmpeg2theora just works. If the sound is too quiet, use the amplifier.py
utility to amplify the wav file before converting it to ogg.
